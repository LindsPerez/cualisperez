	<h1 style="color:Navy;">System Analysis and Usability Test</h1>
	<h2 style="color:Navy;">Part 1: Analyze the website using usability framework</h2>
	<h3 style="color:Navy;">Step 1: Explore and consider the information that goes into (input) or comes out of (output) of the system</h3>
	<blockquote><table style="width:75%">
	<tr>
	<td><b>INPUT</td>
	<td><b>OUTPUT</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Click on “Crosswords and Comics” on the gray bar on the home screen</td>
	<td>A new page that showed a list of available crosswords (9) and one comic. Most items shown were from 2022, with two being from 2016 and 2017 respectively. There was also a link to “Tweet” (should now be labeled as "Posts"). I’m not on X (Twitter) so I can’t log in to see where this takes you, but I’m going to assume that it gives you the option to post/tweet the items on the page.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Type in the search box the word “Crossword”</td>
	<td>New page with nine results shown, seven of them are crossword puzzles (where did the other two go?) and two results are (seemingly unrelated) articles</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Hover over the word “About” and the arrow next to it, a dropdown appears – click on “Meet the staff” </td>
	<td>New page with twelve images and corresponding info on “staff” of the newspaper. Each information section includes the option to contact them via email, with some of those emails being hyperlinked</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>From the “Meet the Staff” page hover over the large font for “The Tower” (really anything in the large heading, to include the established dates and “Catholic University’s Independent Newspaper” and click</td>
	<td>Takes you back to the homepage of the website</td>
	</tr>
	</table></blockquote>
	<h3 style="color:Navy;">Step 2: Critique the site from the perspective of supporting teachers wanting to incorporate original source material into lesson plans and student learning activities</h3>
	<b>Nielson's Heuristics: Analysis of The Tower website</b>
	<ol>
	<li>V<b>isibility of System Status</b> - 
<p>The system was fast to respond to the searches (for “tobacco”, “tobacco use”, “tobacco campus” and the purposely incorrectly spelled search of “tobbacco”) with no notable lag. There was a super brief (fraction of a second) search delay indicator (a rotating circle) that appeared after hitting enter after typing in the search terms. This was a “blink and you’d miss it” situation, but helpful in that it was clear the system was performing the search. There was no clear indication of how search results were sorted though.</p></li>
	<li><b>Match Between the System and the Real World</b> - 
<p>This site looks familiar to a physical paper newspaper and similar to other online college newspapers. The typical format of a picture and first few lines of the article combo is common and expected in the online news world.  The readability of the articles were reasonable for the intended audience of a college campus.</p></li>
	<li><b>User Control and Freedom</b> - 
<p>Performing searches is clear and easy on the site. The search box (and magnifying glass in the header) is clearly visible on all pages. The back button appears to be the only way to re-access search results without performing the search over again, but the back button functions well and takes you directly back to previous pages without having to re-load.</p></li>
	<li><b>Consistency and Standards</b> - 
<p>Pages on the site are consistent in design. The search box is consistent in design and in appearing on each page, as is the “Archive” list on the side of the page. The gray menu bar (just under the title) appears on each page, allowing consistent access to sections and drop downs. Some image links/thumbnails appear to be broken or missing in search results. I did sign up to receive “our mailing list to receive weekly news, politics, arts & entertainment, and sports coverage” and was surprised when it arrived and appeared vastly different than the online newspaper. I understand the content varies, but I assumed the style and formatting would be like the online newspaper.</p></li>
	<li><b>Error Prevention</b> – 
<p>There is no way to filter our irrelevant search results, or to refine searches. It’s unclear what the numbers in parenthesis above the months in archives are for at first. I thought they might be the number of other articles related to my searches, but in clicking on the number it seems it’s just the quantity of articles in each month in total. Within each article’s page, there’s a section for “more stories” along the bottom, but those appear to just link to the most recent articles, not related articles, which could lead to some confusion.</p></li>
	<li><b>Recognition Rather than Recall</b> - 
<p>Within each page of search results, the search term continues to be shown at the top of the page. The appearance of each page of search results is the same in layout, with images consistently shown on top of the articles’ titles and first few lines. The newspaper title, search box, and menu bar are all consistently shown and visible within each search results page.</p></li>
	<li><b>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</b> - 
<p>There is no way to filter down and customize search results, making it hard to see what relevant search results you may have found. Users are also not able to adjust the quantity of search results shown on each page, causing the need to click from page to page of results. As it appears there is no way to “log into” the site, there doesn’t appear to be a way to save searches themselves as “favorites.” Also, while the archives list (from the past ten years at least) is shown on each page, to the right and at the bottom, there is no way to minimize that. If a user is on the site only to browse certain sections or to search for certain terms, they still must do unnecessary scrolling to get past the archives list.</p></li>
	<li><b>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</b> - 
<p>The overall focus on the site is clearly on the articles available. Flash stories are shown scrolling on the top, but this is minimal and doesn’t feel distracting, and there aren’t any advertisements or irrelevant items vying for attention. The clean black and white design of the page also enhances the focus on the news articles.</p></li>
	<li><b>Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Error</b> - 
<p>If a user searches for a mis-spelled term (as I tried while searching for “tobbacco”) not alternatives or “did you mean?” are shown, just a prompt to try the search again. If a search is successful in returning articles, there is no way to filter down those results to ensure relevant articles.</p></li>
	<li><b>Help and Documentation</b> – 
<p>There is no help box, “contact us”, FAQs, or support resources available. There is a section on “Meet the Staff” that includes photos and email contacts for each member, but it isn’t clear who to contact for what purpose. There is also no way to report issues with the site, for example some missing thumbnail images in search results.</p></li>
	</ol>
<br>
<h3 style="color:Navy;">Step 3: Summarize Part 1 with the top 2 strengths and top 2 weaknesses of the system</h3>
<b>Strength 1: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</b>
<br>
<p>The Tower website has an uncluttered and straightforward layout that keeps the focus on the content. Sections, such as Sports, Arts and Entertainment, and News, are easy to navigate to without feeling overwhelmed by too much information or distracting elements. While there is some imagery and moving areas, they are not distracting but instead draw the eye to important news and alerts. The site effectively uses whitespace (negative space) to make sure articles and sections are not competing, while also making it easy for users to scan and locate information. The typography is consistent and easily readable, and the overall color palette is subtle.</p>

<br>
<br><b>Strength 2 – Match Between System and the Real World</b>
<br>
<p>The Tower website presents content in a clear, straightforward manner, how a traditional, paper-based newspaper would. There are sections that correspond to real-world categories that users would be familiar with, such as Arts and Entertainment, Politics, and Sports. The navigation bar is simple and features these categories. The website uses familiar elements, such as headlines, images, and article excerpts, that, again, mirror physical newspapers. The website’s main page organizes articles in a way that reflects real-world journalistic priorities, with flash stories and editor’s picks towards the top and less urgent pieces below. In additional to be like physical newspapers, The Tower website is also similar to other online college newspapers, allowing users to interact with a site they’d feel was familiar and comfortable. Finally, in checking the readability of an article, the levels were around 9-12th grade, making this easily accessible for college students to understand content.</p>

<br>
<br><b>Weakness 1 - Flexibility and Efficiency of Use </b>
<br>
<p>The Tower website doesn’t provide customization features, such as the ability to save favorite articles or set preferences for specific type of content. Users are not able to “log in” to set preferences that might cater to their individual needs. If a user wants to keep track of certain categories (ie: Arts and Entertainment) they have to manually revisit those sections each time. There is also no advanced search functionality, so users cannot filter search results for articles based off authors, date ranges, article types, etc, which could greatly improve efficiency. The website also doesn’t offer the option to minimize areas, specifically the archives list which appears on both the right side of the page and towards the bottom, often causing unnecessary scrolling.</p> 
<br>
<br><img scr="<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/pBCg1G8w/archives-list-on-side-with-numbers.png" alt="archives-list-on-side-with-numbers" border="0" /></a>   <img scr="<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Cs0Dkv4r/Screen-Shot-2025-04-04-at-2-37-13-PM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2025-04-04-at-2-37-13-PM" border="0" /></a>
<br>

<br>
<br><b>Weakness 2 - Error Prevention</b>
<br>
<p>The Tower website’s users are only able to perform a broad search on the site for articles, without the ability to apply filters. Many of the search results are irrelevant and not what the user intended. It’s also inefficient for the user to have to scroll through a list of search results that don’t fit their needs. Filters such as date ranges, categories, and even authors might streamline searches a bit and prevent errors by narrowing down the pool of results to only the truly relevant ones. The user is forced to repeatedly search using different terms in the hopes that one search will eventually yield relevant articles.</p>
<br>
<br><img scr="<a href="https://ibb.co/DHFm4Vbs"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/ycCK0fRG/Initial-search-results-for-Tobacco.png" alt="Initial-search-results-for-Tobacco" border="0" /></a> <img scr="<a href="https://ibb.co/GvJKPtZD"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/FbWS70Q1/relevant-search-results-found-at-bottom-of-page.png" alt="relevant-search-results-found-at-bottom-of-page" border="0" /></a>
<br>

<br>
<br><h2 style="color:Navy;">Part 2: Conduct a "mini-usability test"</h2>
<h3 style="color:Navy;">Step 4: Two Tasks (Observation Form and Questionnaire submitted to Brightspace)</h3>
<h3 style="color:Navy;">Step 5: Comparison of the results from Part 1 and Part 2</h3>
<p>My neighbor and I must have similar personalities because I found that we had many of the same thoughts on the successes and struggles with The Tower website.  When I looked at the website in light of a heuristic review, I felt that the website’s successes were mainly in its responsiveness and aesthetic design. My neighbor also particularly appreciated the website’s attractiveness, noting that she loved that it wasn’t too colorful or crazy. 
When it came time to explore the site, that’s where the confusion started. While the “archive” section is clearly labeled and located on every page, the actual ease of use and functionality is limited. Like me, my neighbor was initially confused on what the numbers above each month meant. Once she started searching, she seemed excited by the ability to look at each month versus the same month of other years, though, like me thought of how helpful it would be if the months could be divided by sections (ie: Arts and Entertainment, Politics, etc) instead of only chronologically.</p>
<p>The struggles I noted were mainly related to the functionality of searches, as well as limitations on flexibility and efficiency.  While looking at the site from the perspective of a teacher looking for specific material on WWI and the Vietnam War, my neighbor struggled with how limited the search functionality is on the site. The results that the site served up were plentiful, but not many were related to her search topics. She tried various searches without success, and, flustered by the inability to filter her searches, finally insisted on stopping the search. I can relate to her struggles, as I also was frustrated by the lack of filters.</p>
<p>Based off a heuristic review and the mini-usability test, I have several improvements to suggest, mostly related to the search functionality. Allowing users to search based off date range, article type, authors, categories, and adding in Boolean operators would all help increase the relevance of search results. The addition of multi-layer searching to filter down results would also benefit users who were searching for specific topics. Clearly showing users how results are displayed would aid in efficiency as well (ie: are results shown based off the frequency of keywords, by date, or something else?)  Clearly including a brief summary of the article (versus the current display of the first few words or sentence) in the article’s metadata could also aid as users try to judge an article’s relevance.</p>
