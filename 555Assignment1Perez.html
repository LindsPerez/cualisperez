			<h2 style="color:DarkSlateGray;">Context and Users</h2>
			<blockquote><p>George C. Marshall High School's <a href="https://www.gcmhslibrary.com/">library</a> serves as the information hub for a diverse student body. Marshall High School is located just East of Tysons, VA, in the dense suburbs twelve miles west of Washington, DC. The high school's enrollment is just over 2100 students (grades 9-12) and 165 faculty members. 14% of the student population receives English Learner Services (ESL) and 12% Special Education Services. 

The GCM website as a whole serves the students, staff, and (in a limited capacity) community members. The library catalog aids students and faculty in the search for pleasure reading reading and research materials. The main page of the catalog site (Destiny Discover) also serves as a virtual hub for various learning resources, such as a bookbinder, library hosted databases, county hosted databases, and more.</p></blockquote>

			<h2 style="color:DarkSlateGray;">Content</h2>
			<blockquote><p><a href="https://fairfax.follettdestiny.com/portal/portal?app=Destiny%20Discover&appId=destiny-HZCK-675G&siteGuid=6B997C14-C79F-4AA2-82E1-2CAAC354F6CF&nav=https:%2F%2Ffairfax.follettdestiny.com%2Fmetasearch%2Fui%2F103273"> Destiny Discover</a> is an online school library catalog. Destiny gives students (and staff) access to the school's library collection, anytime from anywhere. Users can search for books in the school's physical collection, as well as access other school selected digital content. Users can keep track of what books they checkout and create holds and wish lists.

Searches are highly visual with book photos predominately featured. Each catalog item's listing includes the traditional information (author, publisher, genre, call number, etc) but also includes an easily accessible overview. The catalog collection includes physical books, ebooks, and audiobooks, all searchable by various tags such as genre, date published, availability, format, page length, and more. Search results can be viewed in "card view" or book cover view. FCPS students can log in with their account and able to access even more resources.</p></blockquote>
			<h2 style="color:DarkSlateGray;">Unique/Interesting Features</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>"The Back Office" - While the Discover page is so accessible and friendly for those who appreciate a visual representation of their reading choices, there's also the option to access the catalog in a traditional format. This is the called the "back office" and users are able to access it with a quick click at the top of the screen. Suddenly gone are the pictures, colors, and genres, and users are presented with a traditional text box and search function.</li>

				<li>"Rosen Learning Center" - This is an interactive ebook collection that is accessible without logging in, so super helpful to community members or family member's of students. Within this collection, there is basic info on so many topics - from online safety to politics! All information is able to be read online or actually read aloud to the user, making this so user friendly to those who might have a learning disability or not have English as their first language.</li>

				<li>"Book Finder" - This tile liked to a page that made it so easy to find something new to read! Users can choose from a variety of paths to help them choose a new book, including "I loved ___________, I want to read something like it", "I would like expert advice", and "I want to read the book before watching the movie." Each of these sections contains links to pop-culture reading lists, sites such as GoodReads, NY times book lists, and more. There's literally something for everyone!</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 style="color:DarkSlateGray;">Where This System Excels and Areas for Improvement</h2>
<p>Overall I was so impressed with the library website itself and absolutely loved this style of library catalog. Catalogs have certainly come a LONG way since the old wooden card catalogs! Some notable "wins" for this system are:</p>
					<ul><li>This site is overall so user friendly! The colors, the intuitive searches, the available filters, and the wide variety of resources find a way to hit just about any need a user might have. Clearly this was designed with students in mind.</li>
					<li>The ability to easily switch back on forth from the traditional catalog view and the modern set up helps the site appeal to a wide range of users and learning styles.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I'm a huge fan of this style of library catalog, I did notice a few areas for improvement, notably:</p>
<ul><li>The back button feature did not work well at all. It kept taking me to entirely blank pages, or pages with just a few graphics but no information. I tried on different browsers (Chrome and Firefox) and had the same issues on both. In order to get back to the catalog home page, I ended up having to just reload the page on a different tab.</li>
<li> I tried opening the catalog on the my phone and iPad and found the sizing of items on the site felt odd. It wasn't horrible, but clearly the site was designed for a desktop or laptop instead of a mobile device. Given how often high school students access things from their phones, this seems like something to look into.</li>
<li>The "popular" books listed on the main page are all showing as "out" which is because they're, clearly, all checked out. I wish the system could just go down the line and auto-populate with the next available "in" items, or at least have a few of them shown. It makes it seem like the library has most books unavailable.</li>
</ul>
